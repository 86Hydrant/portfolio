# FED21 Data Interaction

Portfolio made for a project in Hyper Island module

## Biggest 3 Challenges:

- Keeping things structured throughout the whole process. My structure started out fantastic but deteriorated the more I felt I was running out of time.

- Getting used to Storyblok and how the data it returns is structured. Some data took longer to select and use than I would ever like to admit.

- Choosing one way of doing things and sticking with it. In lectures and tutorials the class and I were shown many different ways of going about the same things. Some I understood quicker than others but they were easy to get mixed up.

## Biggest 3 learnings:

- Structure may take a little bit of extra time in some ways but will end up saving you a whole lot of time in the long run.

- Having a good routine to get into when you are stuck at home in quarantine and have a lot of work to get done is absolutely essential.

- Do not stay up until 4:30am the night before handing in a project thinking you can fix everything in your exhausted and irritated state (learned that the hard way).

## Tooling

This application uses SASS so that we can write modular CSS.
The CSS you are writing for each component is going to be scoped to these modules only and not affect any other parts of the site.
